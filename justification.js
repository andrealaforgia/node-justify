//Create a function that will justify the column 
//when a string is passed along with maxcol the funtion has to justify the column
//string will always be euqal or < than maxCol

//Plan:
//Will check the length of the word if the word length is euqal to maxCol will return that str
// Else will check the length of each word and compare it to the column
//will fit the words in each column depending on the length of the word
//if only one word can be fitted in the column then will have space after the word to meet the column requirement 
//if two words or more words can be fit in a column will fit the words and have even spaces between them to meet the column requirement
//in order to have even spaces between two or more workds will count the words and subtract that from the maxCol and will divide the spaces evenly
